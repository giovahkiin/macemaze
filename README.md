# macemaze
who will win, a game player or one pointy boi

## Main Concepts
* Physics
* Data-Driven Design
* Graphics

Player pulls a ball towards them (gravitational), where the ball absorbs other, different balls of various sizes. It will bounce off balls bigger than it. The other balls shrink when your following ball hits them, while your following ball gets bigger. You "lose health" if you get hit by your following ball. A "maze" is made using bigger balls, so you can basically "eat" the maze. Your following ball has a speed cap.

Data-Driven Design: Loads positions, sizes, number of balls, etc.

Graphics: some theme (pending)

So it's kinda like Snake + Agar.io
